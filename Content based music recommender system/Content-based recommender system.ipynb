    "A **recommender system** is a type of information filtering system that suggests items to users based on their preferences and behavior. It uses data analysis techniques to understand a user's behavior and to predict what they might like or be interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of recommender systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content-based recommender systems**: This type of system analyzes the characteristics of the items a user has interacted with, such as the content of a movie or the genre of a book, to recommend similar items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative filtering recommender systems**: This type of system analyzes the behavior of multiple users to recommend items that are popular among users with similar interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are used in a variety of applications, such as e-commerce websites, social media platforms, and music and video streaming services, to personalize the user experience and improve engagement. They can also help businesses increase revenue by suggesting additional products or services that a user might be interested in."

    "**(TF-IDF)** can be defined as the calculation of how relevant a word in a series or corpus is to a text. The meaning increases proportionally to the number of times in the text a word appears but is compensated by the word frequency in the corpus (data-set)."
